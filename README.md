# Oredev

This application shows how [Flow](https://github.com/elixir-lang/flow) can be used to model parallel consumption of data from a stream.

## Structure

The application knows how to fetch the starred repositories of a Github user and aggregate them by month.

All examples are in the `/examples` directory and can be run with `mix run <filename`.

## Installation

Assuming you have Elixir >= 1.5 installed, you can use `mix deps.get` to install dependencies.
